0.2 Independent set reduction?

2. Check if the solution produced by "initialise" is feasible
3. write down the local search algorithm for every zone first and then globally
4. sample the locations of the vehicles using randomisation
5. osmnx network visualisation
6. Nof, Nov, Nos to be removed from the parameters file
7. values for beta to be read from a separate file



AS IT IS NOW IT WILLL RETURN VALUE EQUAL TO DEMAND
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW HIGHER VALUES OF DEMAND


8. write the demand constraint differently in the pseudocode i.e.
if facility j belongs in zone z then 
\sum_{zeta \in N(z)} where N(z) the neighboring zones of z

9. prove (in words) that the initial solution is feasible


10. In the end of the algorithm
if the demand on each zone is not met then there is no feasible solution


11. randomness in localsearch?
